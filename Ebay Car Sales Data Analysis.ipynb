    "In this project, our goal is to clean and analyze the eBay Kleinanzeigen used cars data set from a classified section of the German eBay website.  The cleaned dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data) and has over 370,000 rows. However, we've decided to use [DataQuest's](https://www.dataquest.io) dirty version for a more challenging exploration."
